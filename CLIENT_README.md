# FridgeOps: Smart Recycling & Repair Platform

FridgeOps is a mobile-first logistics platform designed to bridge the gap between customers selling old refrigerators and the professional teams who collect, repair, and recycle them. By combining the familiarity of **WhatsApp** with a powerful **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, we’ve created a seamless, automated workflow for every player in the ecosystem.

## 🚀 How the System Works

The journey follows a frictionless path from a customer's first message to the final payment and logistics update.

### 1. Lead Generation (WhatsApp)
Everything starts with a simple WhatsApp message. Customers or "Scouts" (referral partners) send a message to the verified business number to sell or report a fridge.
*   **Zero-Install Entry**: Customers don't need to download an app to start.
*   **Automatic Qualification**: Our AI bot captures location details, photos, and customer consent instantly via chat.

### 2. Intelligent Operations (Admin Dashboard)
Once a lead is captured, it appears instantly on the **Ops Dashboard** (`fridgeops.maruonline.com/ops`).
*   **Centralized Control**: Admins view a "Bento-style" dashboard showing incoming leads organized by status.
*   **Assignment**: With one click, an admin assigns a pickup job to a dedicated Runner.

### 3. Field Execution (Runner Mobile App)
Runners receive an automated SMS or notification. They log in to the **FridgeOps PWA** on their phone's home screen.
*   **Optimized Routing**: Runners see "Today's Route" with direct links to Google Maps for every site.
*   **Proof of Visit**: When they arrive, they scan a unique QR code on the fridge to start the job.
*   **GPS Verification**: The app automatically logs the Runner's GPS location when they verify a payment or report a repair, ensuring complete transparency.

### 4. Client Transparency (Client Portal)
High-volume clients (like hotels or restaurants) can log in to their own **Client Portal** to track their history.
*   **Real-time Tracking**: See exactly where every fridge is in the recycling pipeline.
*   **Simplified Requests**: One-tap "Request Pickup" button for repeat service.

## 🛠 Integration Guide for Partners

Integrating FridgeOps into your existing website or business flow is straightforward and requires minimal technical overhead.

### Option A: The "Chat-to-Sell" Button (Recommended)
Add a floating WhatsApp button or a "Sell your Fridge" link on your website.
*   **URL**: `https://wa.me/[Your_Business_Number]?text=I%20want%20to%20sell%20a%20fridge`
*   **Benefit**: This directs users straight into our automated qualification bot.

### Option B: The Embedded Client Portal
If you have a partner portal, you can link directly to the FridgeOps login page.
*   **URL**: `https://fridgeops.maruonline.com/auth/login`
*   **Benefit**: Professional partners can log in via their phone number to manage their bulk logistics.
